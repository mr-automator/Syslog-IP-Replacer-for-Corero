Peter Cutler

The purpose of this code is to read in syslog generated by a Corero SmartWall DDoS defence appliance and:

1) Anonymize source and destination IP addresses within the SYSLOG messages.
2) Return a file that can be indexed by the Corero SecureWatch Analytics application.
3) Create a backup of the original SYSLOG file (.bak) without modifications.

Usage:

Checklist:
1) Ensure txt files containing your syslog are in the same folder as the python file.
2) Ensure SYSLOG file is raw .txt 
3) Usage is for index=* and index=securewatch_summary syslog input.
4) Ensure index=securewatch_summary input is 10% longer in duration than the index=*.
